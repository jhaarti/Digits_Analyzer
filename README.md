# Digits_Analyzer
This is a digit analyzer . The dataset used is also given .
Here, we firstly import all the required libraries such as, numpy, pandas. scipy is used for additional routines.
for eg, optimization, and sparse matrices.
Statsmodel is known to provide statistical background for other python packages.
After that the dataset is imported and read using pandas.
Our dataset is used here in a matrix form or numpy array form.
For training and testing data, dataset is split into sections as per requirement and the model is trained using Decision tree Classifier as our machine learning algorithm. 
Accuracy of the trained model is then checked so as to know how well the model is trained.
This is pretty much everything done in this notebook.
